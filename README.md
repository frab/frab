# frab - conference management system

frab is a web-based conference planning and management system.
It helps to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers
and to create a schedule.

## Current Status

frab is not under heavy development anymore.
[Releases](https://github.com/frab/frab/releases) merely mark huge updates and
add a changelog.  There are no separate release branches, fixes and development
happen in main.  We want the main branch to be usable at all times.

frab has been used to organize [FrOSCon](https://froscon.de) since 2011, a
conference with more than 100 talks (and as many speakers) in more
than 5 parallel tracks (plus devrooms) over 2 days.
frab has also been used by the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de) until 2023.

The frab wiki hosts a [list of conferences using frab](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki).
*Feel free to add your conference to the wiki*.

Take a look at the [screenshots](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Screenshots)
to get an idea of what frab does. The [full
manual](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Manual) can be found in the wiki.

## Installing

frab is a pretty standard Ruby on Rails application.
There should be plenty of tutorials online on how to install,
deploy and setup these.

See [installation](INSTALL.md) for more frab specific information.

It's possible to run frab via [docker](https://github.com/frab/frab/blob/main/README.docker.md), or on a [PaaS](https://github.com/frab/frab/blob/main/README.PaaS.md) like heroku or dokku.

## Rake Tasks

These are executed from the command line to export conferences and static
schedules, send emails or help with development.  The manual has a chapter on
[rake tasks for production](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Manual#managing-frab-in-production).

More documentation on available [rake tasks](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Rake%20Tasks) can be found in the wiki
or by running `rails -D`.

## Ticket Server

frab supports OTRS, RT and Redmine ticket servers. Instead of sending
event acceptance/rejection mails directly to submitters, frab adds
a ticket to a request tracker.

The ticket server type can be configured for every conference.

Install the iPHoneHandle support if you're using OTRS.

## Localization

Frab's UI has been translated into [several languages](config/locales): de en es fr it pt-BR ru zh.
If a translation for a text is not found, production systems will fallback to the `I18n.default_locale` as configured in `config/environments/production.rb`.

Frab *chooses* the UI's language, by looking at the `?locale=` URL parameter first. If that is unset or contains an unsupported language, Frab falls back to the clients `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` header.
If neither value is in the list of supported languages, frab uses English.

Conferences, events and persons have languages, these are *displayed* in the schedule and are used for the notifications feature.

The mail *notification* feature sends mails to speakers. It sends those notifications in a language the speaker has configured and falls back to English. Also tries to find a match between the conference locales and the speakers locale.

Localization for *model fields*, like the event's description is provided by the mobility gem. This allows frab to publish texts for the same resource in several languages:

* event title, subtitle, description, abstract
* person description, abstract
* track name

If a field has no stored translation, the supported languages will fallback to the `I18n.default_locale`. The unsupported languages, will return nil, until a translation is stored.

Frab uses the models database column, e.g. 'title', for the default language (`I18n.default_locale`), other languages are stored in separate database tables.
Mobility calls that a `column fallback`, it helps with existing installations and avoids JOIN statements if only one language is used.

The default language is assumed to be English (`I18n.default_locale`), but could be changed in an initializer.

## History

frab was originally created for the organization of [FrOSCon 2011](http://www.froscon.de).
FrOSCon has previously used pentabarf (http://pentabarf.org), and although
frab is a completely new implementation, it borrows heavily from pentabarf.

Both FrOSCon and frab owe a lot to pentabarf. But sadly, pentabarf seems to
be abandoned. And several problems make it hard to maintain. Thus we decided
to create a new system.
