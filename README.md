# frab - conference management system

frab is a web-based conference planning and management system.
It helps to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers
and to create a schedule.

## Background

frab was originally created for the organization of FrOSCon 2011 (http://www.froscon.de).
FrOSCon has previously used pentabarf (http://pentabarf.org), and although
frab is a completely new implementation, it borrows heavily from pentabarf.

Both FrOSCon and frab owe a lot to pentabarf. But sadly, pentabarf seems to
be abandoned. And several problems make it hard to maintain. Thus we decided
to create a new system.

## Current Status

frab is under heavy development. There is no stable release yet.
You may want to try to use frab regardless, but be warned, that it may
be a rocky ride.

That being said, frab has been used to organize FrOSCon 2011, a
conference with more than 100 talks (and as many speakers) in more
than 5 parallel tracks (plus devrooms) over 2 days.

## Installing

frab is a pretty standard Ruby on Rails (version 3.2) application.
There should be plenty of tutorials online on how to install,
deploy and setup these.

Basically, to get started you need git, ruby (>= 1.9.3) and bundler
and follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository

    git clone git://github.com/frab/frab.git

2) cd into the directory:

    cd frab

3) Install all necessary gems:

    bundle install

4) Install nodejs:

frab needs a javascript runtime. You should use
nodejs, as it is easier to install than v8.

    apt-get install nodejs

5) Install Imagemagick:

This is a dependency of the paperclip gem. Imagemagick
tools need to be installed to identify and resize images.

Imagemagick should be easy to install using your OS's
preferred package manager (apt-get, yum, brew etc.).

6) Create (and possibly modify) the database configuration:

    cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml

frab bundles all three built-in rails database drivers.
And it should work with all three, although it is best tested
with MySQL and SQLite3 (for development).

7) Create and modify settings:

    cp config/settings.yml.template config/settings.yml

8) Create and setup the database

    rake db:setup

9) Precompile assets (only needed for production)

    rake assets:precompile

10) Generate secret token and add the generated token into `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`

    rake secret
    cp config/initializers/secret_token.rb.example config/initializers/secret_token.rb

11) Start the server

To start frab in the development environment simply run

    rails server

To start frab in the production environment make sure you
did not skip step 8 and run:

    rails server -e production

(Note that for a "real" production environment you
probably do not want to use this script, but rather something
like unicorn or passenger. Note that under Apache 2.x
mod_header is needed.)

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and login as
"admin@example.org" with password "test123".

### Production Environments

If you are running frab in a production environment you have to
take additional steps to build a secure and stable site.

0. Change the password of the inital admin account
1. Change the initial secret token
2. Add a content disposition header, so attachments get downloaded and 
are not displayed in the browser. See `./public/system/attachments/.htaccess` for an example.
3. Add a gem like `exception_notification` to get emails in case of errors.

## Ticket Server

Frab supports OTRS and RT ticket servers. Instead of sending
event acceptance/rejection mails directly to submitters, frab adds
a ticket to a request tracker.

The ticket server type can be configured for every conference.

The iPHoneHandle support needs to be installed in OTRS.

## Rake Tasks

### Export / Import conferences

Creates a folder under tmp/frab\_export containing serialized data and
all attachments:

    RAILS_ENV=production CONFERENCE=acronym rake frab:conference_export

Import a conference into another frab:    

    RAILS_ENV=production rake frab:conference_import

### Sending Mails

    RAILS_ENV=production rake frab:bulk_mailer subject="Conference Invite" from=conference@example.org emails=emails.lst body=body.txt.erb

### Migrating from pentabarf

frab comes with a script that offers limited capabilities of
migrating data from pentabarf. For it to work, you need access
to pentabarf's database and configure it in config/database.yml
under the key "pentabarf".

Then simply run

    rake pentabarf:import:all

Please note, that the script has not been tested with HEAD
and will most probably not work. If you still want to try it
out, checkout the code at the revision the script was last
changed at and upgrade the code and migrate the database
from there.


## Vagrant Server

frab can more easily be tested by using vagrant. First install the
vagrant gem:

    gem install vagrant

Afterwards setup your virtualbox machine, install chef inside and
let vagrant run the frab chef recipes.
Simply run the following command directly inside the frab checkout
directory:

    vagrant up


Sometimes vagrant runs into timing problems, reload the vm:

    vagrant reload

And you can always re-deploy

    vagrant provision

You can now ssh into the box and start the rails app

    vagrant ssh
    cd /srv/frab
    rails server

Visit http://localhost:3000/ to log in to frab.
    - if @conference.feedback_enabled
