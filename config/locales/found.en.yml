      Welcome! It looks as if this is your first time here.
      To get started organizing a conference you need to first
      enter some data about it. You can change most of what
      you enter now later. But some things cannot be changed
      easily after you submit this form, so please read the

      what you enter.
    show_welcome: |
      Welcome, you seem to have just created this
      conference. A good first step would be to go
      to the _Conference Settings_ tab above
      and add a room to this conference. This will
      be needed to schedule your program.
    show_no_event: |
      This conference does not yet have any events.
      (Note that throughout the application, the
      generic term 'event' is used to refer to all
      sessions within your conference, no matter if
      they are talks, workshops, panels or something
      else entirely).
    
      Start adding events by clicking on the
      _Events_ tab above. Or start a call for
      papers, to allow others to submit events for
      you to review.
    recent_changes: "Recent changes"
    recent_changes_text: |
      Once you, or others start creating data for this
      conference, you will find who changed what here.

      you to quickly see if new submissions came in.

          The name of your conference as it shall appear throughout the site.
          Example: 'FrOSCon'
        acronym: |
          A short and unique handle for your conference, using only lower-case
          letters, numbers and underscores. This will be used to identify your
          conference in URLs etc. Example: 'froscon2011'"
        email: |
          Contact email address for your conference. Will be used as reply-to
          address in emails sent out by the system.

        timezone: |
          Please select in what time zone your conference will take place.
          This is needed to correctly display times for your events.
        timeslot_duration: |
          How long do you want the smallest timeslots to be? This essentially
          defines the grid on which you can plan your program. WARNING: This
          one is tricky and cannot be easily changed later, so give this some
          thought. In general, larger timeslots make things a lot simpler, but
          smaller ones make you more flexible. Example: If all you need is to
          schedule 30 minute talks that perfectly align with full and half hours,
          choose 30 minutes as slot size. If you have 1 hour long talks and
          15 minute breaks between them, 15 minutes is the perfect slot size.
          Note that you can make the slot size smaller later on, as long as the
          old slot size is a multiple of the new one. So going from 15 minutes
          down to 5 is fine, while going down to 10 minutes will not work.
        default_timeslots: |
          What is the default length of your events? Example: If you chose
          a timeslot duration of 15 minutes to account for breaks, but your
          talks are usually 1 hour long, select 4, because 4 times 15 minutes is one hour.
