    inputs:
      hints:
        acronym: |
          A short and unique handle for your conference, using only lower-case
          letters, numbers and underscores. This will be used to identify your
          conference in URLs etc. Example: 'froscon2011'
        accepted_event_durations: |
          Use the checkboxes above to determine which options are presented to
          submitters for indicating the duration of their proposed event.
          Submitters will be able to pick one of the values you checked here.
          As conference crew, you will be able to later change events to any
          duration, not only those checked here.
        allowed_event_types: |
          Here you can pick which types of events are accepted as submissions to
          this conference. This list affects only new submissions. Existing submissions
          will not be modified if you alter this list.
        allowed_event_types_extras: |
          If you want the conference to accept event submissions with other types
          than the ones available above, write the event types here. Separate different
          event types with semicolon. Example: 'game;discussion panel'
        attachment_title_is_freeform: |
          If this option is selected, submitters can provide any title they want
          for files they upload as attachments. If this option is deselected, they
          must select between a set of pre-configured titles.
        bulk_notification_enabled: |
          If you enable this, notifications will be sent out in bulk by mail
          or ticket subsystem.
        color: You may define a color for your conference.
        default_recording_license: Default recording license for all talks
        default_timeslots: |
          What is the default length of your events? Example: If you chose
          a timeslot duration of 15 minutes to account for breaks, but your
          talks are usually 1 hour long, select 4, because 4 times 15 minutes is one hour.
        email: |
          Contact email address for your conference. Will be used as reply-to
          address in emails sent out by the system.
        event_languages: Choose which languages events in this conference can be held in.
        event_state_visible: |
          If you enable this, speakers will be able to look up the state
          of their submission in the cfp interface and confirm their attendance
          by pressing the confirm button.
        expenses_enabled: If you enable this, frab will allow you to track expenses of people.
        feedback_enabled: |
          If you enable this, your program export will include links to a feedback
          form where attendees can rate an event.
        max_timeslots: What is the maximum length of a single event (e.g. a single talk)?
        timeslot_duration: |
          How long do you want the smallest timeslots to be? This essentially
          defines the grid on which you can plan your program. WARNING: This
          one is tricky and cannot be easily changed later, so give this some
          thought. In general, larger timeslots make things a lot simpler, but
          smaller ones make you more flexible. Example: If all you need is to
          schedule 30 minute talks that perfectly align with full and half hours,
          choose 30 minutes as slot size. If you have 1 hour long talks and
          15 minute breaks between them, 15 minutes is the perfect slot size.
          Note that you can make the slot size smaller later on, as long as the
          old slot size is a multiple of the new one. So going from 15 minutes
          down to 5 is fine, while going down to 10 minutes will not work.
        timezone: |
          Please select in what time zone your conference will take place.
          This is needed to correctly display times for your events.
        title: |
          The name of your conference as it shall appear throughout the site.
          Example: 'FrOSCon'
        transport_needs_enabled: |
          If you enable this, frab will allow you to track transportation needs of
          people.
