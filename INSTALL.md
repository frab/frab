## Development Setup

Basically, to get started you need git, ruby (>= 2.4) and bundler
and follow these steps:

1) Install nodejs:

frab needs a javascript runtime. You should use
nodejs, as it is easier to install than v8.

    apt-get install nodejs

2) Install Imagemagick and `file`:

These are dependencies of the paperclip gem. Imagemagick
tools need to be installed to identify and resize images.

Imagemagick and file should be easy to install using your OS's
preferred package manager (apt-get, yum, brew etc.).

3) Clone the repository

    git clone git://github.com/frab/frab.git

4) cd into the directory:

    cd frab

5) Modify settings:

Settings are defined via environment variables. frab uses dotenv files to
set these variables. The variables for development mode are set in `.env.development`.
You can also use `.env.local` for local overrides.

6) Run setup

    bin/setup

10) Start the server

To start frab in the development environment simply run

    rails server

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and login as
"admin@example.org" with password "test123".

## Vagrant Server

frab can more easily be tested by using vagrant with chef recipes taking care of the installation process.
More information can be found in these github projects:

* [frab/vagrant-frab](https://github.com/frab/vagrant-frab)
* [frab/chef-frab](https://github.com/frab/chef-frab)


## Docker

See [Docker Readme](README.docker.md)

## Production Deployment

1) Installing database drivers

Instead of running `bin/setup` you need to run bundle install manually, so
you can choose your database gems. To avoid installing database drivers you don't
want to use, exclude drivers with

    bundle install --without="postgresql mysql"

2) Create (and possibly modify) the database configuration:

    cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml

3) Configuration

In Production make sure the config variables are set, copy and edit the file
`env.example` to `.env.production`.

4) Precompile assets

    rake assets:precompile

5) Security considerations

If you are running frab in a production environment you have to
take additional steps to build a secure and stable site.

* Change the password of the initial admin account
* Change the initial secret token
* Add a content disposition header, so attachments get downloaded and
are not displayed in the browser. See `./public/system/attachments/.htaccess` for an example.
* Add a gem like `exception_notification` to get emails in case of errors.

6) Start the server

To start frab in the production environment run

    RACK_ENV=production bundle rails s

Note that when seeding the database in production mode, the password for
admin@example.org will be a random one. It will be printed to the console
in when `rake db:seed` is invoked.
