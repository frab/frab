This essentially defines the grid on which you can plan your program. WARNING: This one is tricky and cannot be easily changed later, so give this some thought. In general, larger timeslots make things a lot simpler, but smaller ones make you more flexible. Example: If all you need is to schedule 30 minute talks that perfectly align with full and half hours, choose 30 minutes as slot size. If you have 1 hour long talks and 15 minute breaks between them, 15 minutes is the perfect slot size. Note that you can make the slot size smaller later on, as long as the old slot size is a multiple of the new one. So going from 15 minutes down to 5 is fine, while going down to 10 minutes will not work."
